# Image Conversion

## Original Tool used by Lilygo

The original conversion tool used by Lilygo can be found [here](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Display-S3/blob/main/tools/Image2Lcd.zip).


The correct settings are:
* Scan mode: Horizon scan
* BitsPixel: 16-bit TrueColor (first option)
* Max Width and Height: 160x80
* Include head data: off
* Scan Right to Left: off
* Scan Bottom to Top: off
* MSB First: on


The 16-bit color tab should have R5G6B5 selected.
